## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a robust sentiment analysis tool that can be easily integrated into any Python-based application. The tool provides an intuitive interface for developers to analyze text sentiments using state-of-the-art AI models without needing extensive AI or NLP expertise.

### Key Features

- **Embedded AI with Watson NLP**: Utilizes IBM Watson NLP's embedded libraries to perform sentiment analysis, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
   
- **Formatted Output**: Extracts and formats relevant information from the Watson NLP library's output, making it easy to understand and integrate into various applications.

- **Modular and Importable Design**: Packaged as a standalone module that can be imported into any Python project, making it highly reusable.

- **Error Handling**: Includes comprehensive error handling to provide appropriate responses for various HTTP response codes, including handling 500 errors gracefully.

- **Deployment with Flask**: The application is deployed using the Flask framework, providing a simple web-based interface for users to analyze text sentiments.

- **Unit Testing**: Includes a suite of unit tests to validate the application's output across different input scenarios, ensuring robustness and reliability.

- **PEP8 Compliance**: All code files have been analyzed for PEP8 compliance using static code analysis tools to ensure adherence to Python coding standards.
